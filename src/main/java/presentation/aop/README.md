##Aspect oriented programming has originated from the concept of "Separation of concerns".

Basically it extends the either procedural or object oriented programming for concerns which are cross-cutting.
Over simplifying one can say that software has functional requirements and non-functional ones. These cross
cutting requirements includes examples like logging, exception handling, thread synchronization, memory management,
optimization and so on. These cross cutting ASPECTS should be expressed and implemented separately and
independently to any other functional parts.
